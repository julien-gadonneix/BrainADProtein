Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects memory, thinking skills, and behavior. It's the most common cause of dementia, slowly impairing cognitive functions and eventually interfering with daily life. Alzheimer's is characterized by the buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the brain, which disrupts communication between nerve cells, causing them to degenerate and die. Though there's no cure yet, ongoing research aims to better understand the disease and to develop effective treatments. This website aims to investigate the evolution of certain proteins in four memory-related brain regions to better understand the progression of this disease.

Usage

1. Run the app.py script in order to activate the flask web serveur (You run the Python script (app.py) using the python app.py command in your terminal. Flask starts a local web server and listens on a certain port (usually, port 5000 by default). You can then access your application in a web browser by visiting the URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/.)

2. Open the HTML main in the same local web server. (Go Live in VSC as explained in class open the local web server)

3. You can navigate between the different pages with button of the web site
